# travelmap

Map of my travels

## Ideas

- Track `first_visited` date or `last_visited` date, maybe
- Have a `trip` array so that markers can be grouped into trips (e.g. "Asia trip with marg")
- Look into grabbing Overland data and use [marker clustering](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/marker-clustering). But don't get all data, get data within the cities specifically then clean it so it's not overly revealing. Maybe by city. So don't do in Nola, maybe.
  - **I can import GeoJSON data, which is what Overland uses**

## To Do

- Use clustering
