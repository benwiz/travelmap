# travelmap

Map of my travels

## Ideas

- Maybe track dates. Consider `first_visited` or an array of all dates.
- Have a `trip` array so that markers can be grouped into trips (e.g. "Asia trip with marg")
- Consider importing Overland data, make it so only visible at certain zoom level or just make the dots small enough. Overland data is GeoJSON which should be easy to import. Maybe just want a Python/Node.js script that imports the data then commits to github, eventually maybe lambda and s3, but not to start.

## To Do

- Add the rest of the cities
- Figure out overland data
- Better markers
